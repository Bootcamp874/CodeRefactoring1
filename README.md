## Summary 
A simple sematic website was created mainly to get a greater understanding of the proper usage of HTML tags,focusing on the best practices for a beginner developer.Appropriate comments were added to point out the changes that made the code semantic.Not only the HTML, but the CSS was modified to meet best practices. In simple words, the code in this project is putting words into practice.
